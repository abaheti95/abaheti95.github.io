## About Me

Hi! My name is Ashutosh Baheti. I am a Computer Science PhD student working with [Prof. Alan Ritter](http://aritter.github.io/) at The Ohio State University. I believe language is one of the most powerful tools invented by mankind and giving computers the power for language will revolutionize the way we live. My research interests are Natural Language Understanding (NLU), Generation (NLG) and general Artificial Intelligence (AI). My current research focuses on Automatic Dialog Systems and problem related to it.

Before joining my PhD program, I was a Research Fellow at Microsoft Research (MSR), India for one year. I worked with [Dr. Monojit Choudhury](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/monojitc/) on word-level language identification of code-switched text. Before that, I completed my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur.
